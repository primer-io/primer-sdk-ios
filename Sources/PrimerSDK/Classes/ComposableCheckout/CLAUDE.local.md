- every time you add/remove files form the directory, please run `pod install`
- never use print statements in the code, always use LogReporter protocol that provides logger.debug(message) out of the box.
- taking screenshots alone right after you build the ap with xcode-server MCP will not show you the actual situation because i need to manually navigate to the wanted screen, stop doing that.
- Don't add an extensive summary at the end of a task, only critical details
- no need to think or plan any kind of migrations since we are still in the development phase of ComposableCheckout, always behave like noone is still using this framework yet.
