# PrimerSDK DI Container Fix

## Issues Resolved

This fix addresses the following issues in the Dependency Injection container implementation:

1. **Protocol Conformance Issue:** Extension methods like `singleton` and `module` weren't visible when using `any ContainerRegistrationBuilder`. This is because protocol extensions aren't visible through existential types (when using `any`).

2. **Async Context Issue:** Async property access was happening in functions that don't support concurrency.

3. **Nil Safety Issue:** Incompatible nil usage with ContainerProtocol.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed DIContainer.swift:

- **Protocol Conformance Issue:**
  - Instead of trying to use extension methods through the existential type, we now cast to the concrete `Container` type and directly use its internal registration methods.
  - Replaced the module pattern with direct method calls to separate registration functions for better organization.

- **Async Context Issue:**
  - Added proper error handling in the `currentSync` getter to safely handle async-to-sync conversion.

- **Nil Safety Issue:**
  - Modified the `setContainer` setter to handle the nil case correctly, preserving the existing container if available or creating a new one if needed.

### 2. Created missing TypeKey.swift:
  - Implemented the missing `TypeKey` structure that is referenced in the code but was not included in the provided files.

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Modular Registration:**
   - Replaced the `module` pattern with direct method calls to separate registration functions for better organization and clarity.

2. **Concrete Type Usage:**
   - Switched from using protocol existential types with extensions to concrete type references.

3. **Proper Error Handling:**
   - Added proper try/catch blocks around async-to-sync conversions.

4. **Nil Safety:**
   - Improved handling of nil values to prevent crashes.

## Usage

To use this improved implementation:

1. Copy the fixed files to your project
2. Initialize your container in your app delegate:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Set up the main container
    Task {
        await DIContainer.setupMainContainer()
    }
    return true
}
```

## SOLID Principles Applied

- **Single Responsibility:** Each class and method has a clear, single purpose
- **Open/Closed:** The container is extensible without modification (new dependency types can be added)
- **Liskov Substitution:** ContainerProtocol implementations are substitutable
- **Interface Segregation:** Protocols are focused and minimal
- **Dependency Inversion:** The system depends on abstractions (protocols) not concrete implementations
