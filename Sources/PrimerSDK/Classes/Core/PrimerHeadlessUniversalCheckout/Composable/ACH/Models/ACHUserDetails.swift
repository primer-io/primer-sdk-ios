/**
 * The protocol includes methods for updating user details with new data collected during the transaction process,
  * as well as a factory method for creating a new instance of `ACHUserDetails` with all fields initialized to empty strings.
  *
  * Methods:
  *  - `update(with:)`: Updates the `ACHUserDetails` instance with new data from a given `ACHUserDetailsCollectableData` instance.
  *    This method should be used to reflect any changes in the user's information that came from the client session.
  *
  *  - `emptyUserDetails()`: Factory method that returns a new `ACHUserDetails` instance where all user detail fields are initialized to empty strings.
  *    Use this method to create a default state for `ACHUserDetails` with no pre-filled information.
