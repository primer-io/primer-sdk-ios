 * - `paymentSessionFinalized`: Indicates a successful finalization of a payment session. It caries:
 *     - `authToken` string, which is used for further API interactions.
 *
 * - `viewInitialized`: Indicates that the Klarna view has been initialized. This is the first step in the Klarna view handling process.
