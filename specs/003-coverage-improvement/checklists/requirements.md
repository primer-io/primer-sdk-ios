# Specification Quality Checklist: CheckoutComponents Code Coverage Improvement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

✅ **Specification is complete and ready for planning**

- All 5 user stories are prioritized (P1-P4) with clear business value
- Success criteria include both 90% target (SC-001) and pragmatic 80% fallback (SC-002)
- Presentation layer refactoring clearly marked as optional/high-risk
- Rollout strategy includes decision point after Phase 3
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are testable and specific
