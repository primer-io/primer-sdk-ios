- Do not commit, push, or run/build the project yourself; wait for instructions
- Do not run swiftlint after changes
- Never commit and push yourself unless I tell you to do so
- Never try building xcode project yourself searching for build errors
- After updating crucial parts of the code, update relevant CLAUDE.md files. CLAUDE.md files should not have any recording of history unless explicitly added and noted
